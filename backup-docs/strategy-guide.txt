1. Trend Analysis Block

This block focuses on identifying whether the market is trending upward, downward, or moving sideways. Your bot uses several well-known indicators together to evaluate trend health and direction:

• ADX (Average Directional Index)

Measures the strength of the trend.
– ADX above 20 usually signals a strong trend.
– Combined with DI+ and DI–, it shows whether bulls or bears are in control.

• DI+ and DI– (Directional Indicators)

Used together with ADX to determine the direction of the trend.
– DI+ > DI– suggests bullish momentum.

• MACD and MACD Histogram

– Positive histogram bars indicate upside momentum.
– If the last few bars are rising, it implies increasing buying pressure.

• Momentum (ROC)

Shows how quickly the price is moving.
Positive values indicate upward momentum.

• AO (Awesome Oscillator)

Confirms whether short-term momentum aligns with long-term momentum.

• EMA20 / EMA50 Structure

A classic trend confirmation setup:
– Price above EMA20, and EMA20 above EMA50, often marks a strong uptrend.

• Higher-Timeframe Confirmation (1h)

The bot checks if the 1-hour chart also supports the trend.
This makes the signal more reliable and filters out fake spikes.

2. Oscillator Block

Oscillators show whether the market is overbought, oversold, or in a neutral state. Your bot uses a well-balanced combination:

• RSI (Relative Strength Index)

Values between 45–65 indicate a healthy, sustainable trend.
Oversold reversals are also detected.

• Stochastic K

Shows whether price is gaining momentum inside its range.
Crossing above 50 is considered bullish.

• CCI (Commodity Channel Index)

CCI above 100 often marks strong bullish energy.

• Stochastic RSI

Captures momentum shifts earlier than classic RSI.

• Williams %R

– Values above –60 support bullish momentum.
– Helps filter out weak setups.

• Ultimate Oscillator

A multi-timeframe oscillator that works well in volatile markets.

3. Volume & Power Block

This part focuses on actual buying pressure — whether real money is flowing into the coin.

• OBV (On-Balance Volume)

A rising OBV line suggests that larger players are accumulating.
Your bot checks OBV over a 10-bar period for trend direction.

• Bull and Bear Power

– Bull Power > 0 means buyers dominate the upper range.
– Bear Power < 0 shows sellers are relatively weak.

• Volume Spike Detection

The bot identifies unusual volume bursts (1.5× above the average), which often precede short-term moves.

• OBV + Volume Alignment

When both OBV and volume spikes agree, it’s a strong confirmation of buying interest.

4. Price Action Block

This block examines actual candlestick behavior — something algorithms often ignore, but traders rely heavily on.

• Long Lower Wick (Hammer-type candles)

Indicates buyers stepped in aggressively after a dip.

• Strong Green Candle

A solid bullish candle with a meaningful body, showing conviction.

• No Recent Collapse

The bot checks the past 96 candles to ensure the coin hasn’t experienced a sharp dump.
This removes unstable or manipulated charts.

• EMA20 Breakout

When price crosses above EMA20, it often signals a momentum shift.

• Minimum Volume Condition

Ensures each candle has enough trading activity.
This prevents low-liquidity coins from producing false signals.

5. Prefilter Layer (Very Important)

Before performing any technical analysis, the bot eliminates coins that are statistically “bad trades.”

• 24-Hour Volume Filter

Coins with less than $5M daily volume are removed.
Low liquidity = high slippage and unreliable TA.

• Minimum Price Filter

Coins under $0.02 are excluded due to manipulation risks.

• 24-Hour Price Change Filter

Only coins within –15% to +20% daily change remain.
Avoids both collapsing charts and overstretched pumps.

• Cooldown System

If a coin generated a signal recently, it won’t trigger again for the next 60 minutes.

• Top-Volume Limiting

If the market has too many candidates, only the top-volume coins are analyzed.

6. Multi-Timeframe Structure

Your bot analyzes data across several timeframes:
	•	15m (main timeframe)
	•	1h (trend confirmation)
	•	4h (optional for future upgrades)
